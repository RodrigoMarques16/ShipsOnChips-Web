/**
 * The class common to all ships. It is meant to be specialized by concrete
 * ships, those submitted by players. Concrete ships are expected to be in the
 * default package (no package declaration) and provide an implementation of the
 * move() method. This method is invoked once per round by the game engine (the
 * World) and will be able to execute actions such as:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>rotate(double) - the ship by given angle in radians</li>
 * <li>changeSpeed(double) - the change the speed of ship and sail around the
 * world</li>
 * <li>fire(Munition) - to fire a munition against other ships</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * These methods create instances of the corresponding implementation of the
 * ShipCommand interface and store them, so that latter on the execute() method
 * may be invoked to execute them. With this approach, if the methods in the
 * list above are called more than once, only the last is effectively executed.
 * 
 * Other methods can be override, such as:
 * <ul>
 * <li>init() - to initialize the ship</li>
 * <li>getName() - to assign a name to the ship</li>
 * <li>getColor() - to assign an HTML color to the ship</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * This can be instantiated as it provides default implementations to all
 * methods that can be provided by concrete ships. The default definitions are
 * always empty instruction blocks.

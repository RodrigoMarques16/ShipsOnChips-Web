/**
 * This package contains classes for managing games. The Manager class is main
 * class with methods called remotely by the web clients. It has a single
 * instance that provides a single access point to this package, thus following
 * both the <b>Singleton</b> and <b>Facade</b> design patterns. The rest of the
 * classes manage players.
